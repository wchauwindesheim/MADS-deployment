## install docker
Yes, docker is supposed to fix the "this runs on my machine" problem.
No, this doesnt mean that this is fixed for installing docker itself...

Please go to the [docker website](https://docs.docker.com) to check how you can install docker on your machine.
However, since we have access to Ubuntu VMs, I added a script that automates installation on a Ubuntu 22.04 server.

### VM instructions
1. Create a 'Ubuntu 22.04' VM with 1 core, 8GB of RAM.
2. Clone this repo
3. run `./install-docker.sh`

Then, setup up your VM as always.
You could use my script from `https://github.com/raoulg/serverinstall/` for that,
which can be run very simply by running
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raoulg/serverinstall/refs/heads/master/generalserver.sh | bash
```
to install things like `zsh`, `eza`, `starship`, `rye`  and I add some aliases to the `.zshrc` file.
This script is still experimental, it is very opinionated and subject to frequent changes, but it improves my experience so
it might do the same for you. Of course, you can also make your own script, or do it manually.
