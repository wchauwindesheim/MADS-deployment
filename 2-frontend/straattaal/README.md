# slanggen

First, build the environment with
```bash
rye sync --all-features
```
We use `--all-features` because we also want to install the optional packages (`fastapi`,` beautifulsoup4`.)

and activate with
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Note how I added
```toml
[[tool.rye.sources]]
name = "torch-cpu"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"
```
This makes sure that you dont download an additional 2.5GB of GPU dependencies, if you dont need them.
This can be essential in keeping the container within a manageable size.

train the model:
```bash
python src/slanggen/main.py
```
This should fill the `assets` folder with a file `straattaal.txt` and fill the `artefacts` folder with a trained model.
Check this with `ls`

If everything works as expected, you can build the `src/slanggen` package into a wheel:
```bash
rye build --clean
```

I published slanggen at [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/slangpy/) which you can do with
`rye publish` after making an account.

`rye build` should produce a `dist` folder, and shoud add these two files:
```bash
❯ lsd dist
.rw-r--r--@ 9.5k username  4 Dec 14:35  slanggen-0.3.1.tar.gz
.rw-r--r--@ 6.0k username  4 Dec 14:35  slanggen-0.3.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

With this, you can now run

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
And this will start an api at http://127.0.0.1:80
Test if everything works as expected.

# Exercise
create a Dockerfile that:
- uses a small build of torch
- installs the requirements for the backend
- copies all necessary backend files. Pay special attention to required paths!
- study `backend/app.py` to see what is expected
- install the slanggen from the wheel
- expose port 80

create a Makefile that:
- checks for the wheel. If the wheel doesnt exist, use `rye` to build it
- checks if the trained model is present. If not, train the file. 
- builds the docker image, if the wheel and model exist
- runs the docker on port 80 
- test if you can access the application via SURF

Additional:
- split up straattaal into multiple dockerfiles
- implement docker-compose.yml for straattaal
